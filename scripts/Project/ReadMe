Output
- display.py 1st part plots clusters second finds centroids (for red circles) 
- display_images.py 1st part plots clusters second finds centroids (for 4 images) 

Processing
- combine2 and 3 combines corresponding frames of the center_radius and pic_orientation to match with the uav poses
- orientation.py finds the orientation and position of the image
- center_radius.py finds the center and radius of the ball along with its radius 
- pixel_to_world.py finds the  corresponding global coordinates of the circles along with their radius
- pixel_to_world_images.py finds the  corresponding global coordinates of the images along with their orientation
